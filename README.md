The What to Watch app is designed to help users make educated decisions about what show they want to binge next! Users can view a show's trailer right in the UI and also leave reviews to let other users know how they felt about it.

- Connecting to a 3rd party API to pull in more shows.
- Introducing pagination to limit around 10 or so shows per page.

### User Stories:

#### MVP Requirements:
    - A user must be able to sign up, sign in, log out, and change their password.
    - An unauthenticated user should be able to view the home page and feed of TV Shows.
    - An unauthenticated user should not be able to add, edit, or delete a review.
    - An authenticated user should be able to view the show feed and also add, edit or delete reviews in which they are the owner.

#### Stretch Goals:
    - A user should be able to view all of their authored reviews.
    - A user should be able to view all of another user's reviews.
    - A user should be able to sort reviews by average rating.
